This Kit is a really simple Kit for complete newbies n Python. I'll be adding more stuff as times goes by. Right now there is some links, 2 Notebook-files that will run in Jupyter Notebook, a few math examples in basic Python format.

The best way to get going is to install Anaconda (see below) and then launch Anaconda Navigator. Inside of Anaconda you can start Jupyter Notebook which is a great tool for testing and creating multi modal documents with both code and text/image. This is the way I've created the Notebook about basic Python and maths in Python.
